# Spotify UNwrapped



This is just a conglomeration of my automation projects specifically for general organization/workflow improvement/productivity help for myself. 

## Summary
This is a project I will be embarking on throughout 2021  (...at least, from February 2021 onward) that I've dubbed Spotify UNwrapped. The purpose is to, at the end of each year, give not just a cursory (or "wrapped") look at my year-in-audio, but a detailed, data-driven look instead :)

This is purely for fun! I'm curious if I'll be able to look back at my year and see noticeable trends in my audio listening habits. To do this, I will be accessing the Spotify API for my user data as well as audio features of each song. I will also be accessing the Lyrics Genius API to gather lyrics for each song I listen to so I can carry out sentiment analysis at the end of the year! The bulk of the work for this project will occur once the year ends, barring any data collection snags during the year. 


I'll see you all in 2022!
